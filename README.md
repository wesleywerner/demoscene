# Demoscene

This is a browser based WebGL demo inspired by the old schoold Amiga demoscene.

*This is a work in progress.*

# Goal

It displays a collection of visual effects (demolets), switching each out for new ones over time. The idea is to give a transition between visual styles through a constantly changing canvas.

In addition to giving a sensory experience, this project aims to provide a modular design to easily add new demolets.

# Technology

This project uses WebGL through the [Pixi][1] library.
